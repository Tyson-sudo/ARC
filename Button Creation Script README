X3D Button Injector

This Python script simplifies embedding multiple X3D models into an HTML file. It automatically copies your .x3d files to a specified directory and inserts the necessary HTML <switch> and <button> elements into your HTML template.

Usage

Run the script from the command line with the following arguments:

    --input-folder or -i: The folder containing your .x3d files.

    --output-folder or -o: The destination folder for the copied .x3d files.

    --html-file or -H: The HTML file to be modified.

Example:
Bash

python your_script_name.py -i ./my_models -o ./assets -H ./index.html

HTML Template

Your HTML file must contain two markers for the script to work:

    PRAGMA1: The script will replace this line with the <group> and <switch> elements for each of your X3D models.

    PRAGMA2: The script will replace this line with a <div class="controls"> containing a toggle button for each model.

Note: You'll need to write your own toggleVisibility JavaScript function in your HTML file to handle the button clicks.
